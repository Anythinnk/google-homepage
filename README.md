This project aims to get me to start thinking about how elements are placed on a page and roughly how they are styled and aligned.
To do so, I will attempt to build a replica of the google.com homepage, but without its functionalities.

These are the skills learnt and demonstrated while working towards the above objective:
- CSS grid to place the different areas of the page
- Flexbox for any areas that require internal styling (such as the searchbox and its icons, and the nav bars)
- CSS styling properties to style the different elements
- Basic hover effects for the placeholder links, buttons and the search bar
- Attempt at responsive web design by resizing the search bar based on the window width
